    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is one of my favorite dishes, a slight modification of the classical Italian Carbonara.</p>
    <p>Myself and my partner thought we'd combine our love for bbq and Italian food into one tasty dish. </p>
    <p>We hope you enjoy!!</p>
    <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken (100g+ per person)</li>
        <li>Chorizo (50g+ per person)</li>
        <li>Mushrooms, the more the merrier!</li>
        <li>Cream 200ml+</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And of course add your favorite pasta. Ours is Penne!</p>
    <h3><strong>Preparation/Cooking:</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Heat up a decent sized pan (medium/high range), and put in your Chorizo first. This will provide you with natural oils from the chorizo, so no need to add any oil!.</p>
            <p>Then add your Chicken and Mushroom and cook to your liking. (Dont forget you'll be putting your pasta into the pan, so be prepared for 2+ full servings of pasta in the pan aswell.)</p></li>
            <li><p>While the body of the dish is cooking off, grab a seperate pot and cook your pasta.</p></li>
            <li><p>When you've cooked the body of your dish (meats and veg), your now ready to make the sauce.</p>
        <p>Reduce heat to a low/medium range. Add your cream to the pan. Let it reduce for roughly 2 minutes. </p>
        <p>This allows some water to cook out of the cream, thickening it, and also allows the body of the dish to fuse with the sauce, combining all the flavors into one!!</p></li>
        <li><p>Next we want to finish our sauce. Slowly add in the parmesan. You should notice the sauce beginning to thicken.</p> 
            <p>When you stir the contents of the pan, you should be able to see the surface of the pan for a couple seconds. That's how you know your sauce is thick enough!</p></li>
        <li><p>Of course you can add more parmesan to your liking, salt and pepper to garnish.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="endlist">I hope you enjoy our take on the classical Carbonara! Chorizo is an absolute neccessity in our house and hopefully it is in yours now too!</p>
